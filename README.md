# CF Simulate

CF Simulate is a curated collection of examples showcasing the application of Continuous Floquet theory up to second order for effective Hamiltonian simulations, alongside exact simulations for comparative analysis, as described in the publication by Chavez et al.

## Features

- **Effective Hamiltonian Simulation**: Simulation of effective Hamiltonians up to second order for various systems.
- **Numerical Simulation**: Perform numerical simulations for various systems.
- **Versatile Toolkit**: Provides a range of tools and functions for similar exact and effective calculations.

## Installation

To install CF Simulate, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CF-simulate.git
```

*Note*: This code is designed to be used with SLURM Workload Manager.

## Usage

1. Effective Hamiltonian Simulation for a specific system:

```bash
    # Execute the exact simulation script after navigating to the corresponding directory
    ./Run_effective.sh
```
This command will execute the effective Hamiltonian simulation module.

2. Numerical Simulation for a specific system:

```bash
    # Execute the exact simulation script after navigating to the corresponding directory
    ./Run_exact.sh
```
Execute this command to perform numerical simulations up to second-order accuracy.
